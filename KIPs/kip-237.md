## Abstract
Reduce disk storage by compressing data, cutting its size by 50% over.

## Motivation
Kaia has focused on optimizing disk storage, effectively reducing the state trie size through state migration and live pruning.
However, these optimizations only address the state trie data. There is still significant potential for further reductions in storage.
This KIP targets three types of data: header, body, and receipts.

For each block processed, the header, body, and receipts data are generated.
These data are progressively stored on disk, consuming a substantial amount of storage.
Based on the migrated chain data (as of 12/02/2024), the header, body, and receipts account for 10.4%, 28.1%, and 40.9% of the total size, respectively, which together occupy 79.4% of the node's disk space.

We propose implementing storage compression techniques to reduce the size of these three data types—header, body, and receipts—thereby improving disk space utilization.

### Compression
A node periodically compresses storage in a background thread and removes the original data once it is confirmed safe to do so.
Data is compressed in units called "chunks," with the chunk size determined by a CLI flag.
The default chunk size is 1MB. For example, if the target data size is 10MB, the data will be divided into 10 chunks.
There is a tradeoff between speed and compression rate. Larger chunk sizes result in more effective compression but introduce higher compression and decompression overhead (time).

### Decompression
Decompression is required when a node receives a query (header, body, or receipts).
The node first searches for the corresponding data in the original database.
If the data is not found, it locates the decompressed chunk and performs the decompression.

### Retention
Retention follows the same semantics as LivePruning, preserving the latest n blocks to prevent them from being compressed.

### Ecosystem changes
No changes are required to the existing API and SDK.
