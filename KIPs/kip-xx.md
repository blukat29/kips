## Abstract

Reduce the calldata gas costs to the [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028) level. The purpose is to achieve better compatibility with Ethereum-oriented SDKs and tools.

## Motivation

Since the introduction of [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028), several bundler software solutions have been developed.

The eth_estimateUserOperationGas API calculates the gas required for a userOperation. This estimate is computed based on the inputâ€™s composition, which includes both nonzero and zero bytes. Following the Istanbul hardfork, Ethereum set the gas cost at 16 gas per nonzero byte and 4 gas per zero byte. As a result, some bundlers have adopted predefined gas costs for these byte types.

To maintain compatibility with Ethereum's tooling ecosystem, the Kaia mainnet aligns its gas pricing with the specifications of EIP-2028 introduced in the Prague hardfork, which defines new costs for nonzero and zero bytes.

## Specification

The gas cost distinguishes between non-zero and zero bytes, assigning 16 and 4 gas units to each, respectively.

### Overview

The calldata costs has been depending on the transaction types and hardfork levels.

Since the genesis block, calldata gas calculation was calculated using the formula:  
Transaction type 0 (Legacy):
`nonzero_bytes_in_calldata` * 68 + `zero_bytes_in_calldata` * 4  
Other types:
`nonzero_bytes_in_calldata` * 100 + `zero_bytes_in_calldata` * 100

Since the Istanbul hardfork, the calculation was simplified to the latter:  
For all transaction types: `nonzero_bytes_in_calldata` * 100 + `zero_bytes_in_calldata` * 100  

This proposal introduces a new hardfork in which the formula will be:  
For all transaction types: `nonzero_bytes_in_calldata` * 16 + `zero_bytes_in_calldata` * 4  
which is identical to [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028).

## Backward Compatibility

The gas pricing change is backwards incompatible since the hardfork.

SDKs and Wallets will be able to continue operating with no change as they usually use `eth_estimateGas` API.
